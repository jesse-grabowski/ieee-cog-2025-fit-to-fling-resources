## Alphabet Indexing

Use the English alphabet in uppercase letters indexed from 0 to 25 as follows:  
`A (0), B (1), C (2), D (3), E (4), F (5), G (6), H (7), I (8), J (9), K (10), L (11), M (12), N (13), O (14), P (15), Q (16), R (17), S (18), T (19), U (20), V (21), W (22), X (23), Y (24), Z (25)`

## Instructions

1. If `Number` is between 0 and 25 (inclusive), output the letter at that index in the alphabet (0-based). In this case, ignore the input `Letter` entirely.
2. If `Number` is 26 or greater, output the original `Letter` exactly as given, in uppercase, without any changes or calculations.
3. Do not combine or modify `Letter` and `Number` in any other way.
4. Output exactly one uppercase letter only â€” no extra characters, spaces, lines, explanations, or formatting.
