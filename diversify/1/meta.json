In situations where Number >= 26, you'd simply return the original Letter as mentioned. For instance, if Input were Letter: B and Number: 30, the Output would still remain 'B'.",

      "B\n\nExplanation: Since the number (35) is greater than or equal to 26, we keep the initial letter (\"B\") as instructed in the problem statement.",
      "S\nIn this case, since the number is greater than 26 (specifically, it's larger than 25 to correspond to an index in our 0-based alphabet list), you should output the original letter unchanged. Hence, the uppercase letter 'B' becomes the answer. \n\nOutput: B",

      "C",

      "R",
      "Q\n\nExplanation: The number 15 falls within this range (0 to 25 inclusive), so we reference the index in the alphabet to get the letter at that position. With 'A' being at index 0, 'D', which is at index 3 + 1=4, corresponds with the 15th character counting from 0, namely the letter 'Q'.",
      "J",

      "G\nIn this case, since the number is greater than 25 (which would be the highest index on a 0-based scale in a list of our given alphabet), we output the original letter unchanged.

      "Q\nIn this case, since the number (28) is equal to or greater than 26 which means we do not manipulate the given letter \"Q\" and output it as-is. So, the output for Letter 'Q' with Number 28 would be the original character: Q.",
      "R\nIn this case, since the number is greater than 26 (specifically, it's greater than 51 assuming we're working with standard 0-based indexing for the English alphabet), you simply output the original letter. Therefore, for the input \"Letter: R\" and Number: 44, the output would be \"R\".",
      "R\nIn this case, since the number is greater than 26 (specifically, it's greater than 51% of 26), there's no need to adjust for any index in the alphabet. Therefore, we return the original Letter unchanged.",

      "<response too many tokens - inference timeout exceeded>",
      "V\nIn this case, since the number is greater than 26, we simply return the original letter (V).",
      "U\n\nExplanation: The number given is 16; as it's less than 26, we look to find its position in the zero-based indexed alphabet list which starts at A (index 0). Hence, 16 refers to the letter 'U', the 17th letter of the English alphabet.",

      "W\n\nExplanation: Since the number (30) exceeds 25, we do not change the input letter to a corresponding alphabet index and retain the original letter 'W'.",
      "W\nIn this case, since the number is greater than 26 (specifically, it's greater than 51; as A=0 and there are only 26 letters in total), we output the original letter unchanged. Therefore, given your input of \"W\" with a number 48, the output will be:\n\nOutput: W",
