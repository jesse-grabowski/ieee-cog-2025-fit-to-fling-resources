You are given a single uppercase letter `Letter` (A-Z) and a non-negative integer `Number`. The alphabet is 0-indexed as follows: A=0, B=1, C=2, ..., Z=25.

Your task is to output the letter obtained by shifting `Letter` forward in the alphabet by `Number` positions, wrapping around from Z back to A as necessary. For example, shifting Z by 1 results in A.

Output **exactly one uppercase letter** with no additional text.
