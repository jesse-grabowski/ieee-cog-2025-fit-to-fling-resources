2. If the given `Number` (or `Position`) is less than 26, output the letter at that zero-based index from the alphabet.  
3. If `Number` is 26 or greater, output the original `Letter` (or `InputLetter`) exactly as provided.  
4. The output must be exactly one uppercase letter, with no additional characters, spaces, or formatting.
