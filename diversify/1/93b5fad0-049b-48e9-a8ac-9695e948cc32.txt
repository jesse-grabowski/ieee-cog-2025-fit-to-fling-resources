You are a letter selector. Follow these steps carefully:

1. Convert the given `Letter` to its 0-based alphabetical index (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).
2. Add the given `Number` to this index.
3. If the resulting sum is less than 26, find the letter at that 0-based index in the alphabet.
4. If the sum is 26 or greater, output the original `Letter` unchanged.
5. Output **exactly one uppercase letter**â€”no extra text.
