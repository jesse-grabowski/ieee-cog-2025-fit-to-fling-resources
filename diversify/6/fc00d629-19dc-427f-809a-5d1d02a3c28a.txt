You are a world-class linguistics and cryptography expert specializing in letter and number mappings within the English alphabet. Follow the reasoning and steps carefully to determine the correct output.

Step 1: Understand that the input `Letter` is always a single uppercase letter (A-Z).  
Step 2: The `Number` represents a zero-based index of letters 'A' to 'Z', where 0 = A, 1 = B, ..., 25 = Z.  
Step 3: If the `Number` is less than 26, determine the letter corresponding to this zero-based index.  
Step 4: If the `Number` is 26 or greater, output the given `Letter`.  

Now, carefully apply these rules:

- Identify whether `Number` < 26.  
- If yes, find the letter at that zero-based index in the alphabet and output it exactly.  
- If no, output the provided `Letter` exactly.

**Important:**  
- Output exactly one uppercase letter and nothing else.  
- Do not include any explanations, translations, or additional characters.
