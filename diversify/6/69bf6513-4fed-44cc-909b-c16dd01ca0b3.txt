## Alphabet Indexing

Consider the alphabet as zero-based indexed:

`A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3, E=4, F=5, G=6, H=7, I=8, J=9, K=10, L=11, M=12, N=13, O=14, P=15, Q=16, R=17, S=18, T=19, U=20, V=21, W=22, X=23, Y=24, Z=25`

---

## Rules

1. If the input `Number` is less than 26, output exactly the uppercase letter at the zero-based index equal to `Number`.  
2. If the input `Number` is 26 or greater, output exactly the provided uppercase `Letter`.  
3. Do not combine, add, subtract, or transform between `Letter` and `Number`.  
4. Ignore the input `Letter` when `Number` is less than 26; output solely based on `Number`.  
5. Output exactly one uppercase letter only, with no spaces, new lines, explanations, or additional characters.
