## Alphabet Indexing

Consider the alphabet as zero-based indexed:

`A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3, E=4, F=5, G=6, H=7, I=8, J=9, K=10, L=11, M=12, N=13, O=14, P=15, Q=16, R=17, S=18, T=19, U=20, V=21, W=22, X=23, Y=24, Z=25`

---

## Detailed Rules

1. When the input `Number` is **less than 26**, completely ignore the input `Letter` and output the uppercase letter at the zero-based index corresponding exactly to the `Number`. For example, if `Number` is 22, output `W`.
2. When the input `Number` is **26 or greater**, output the original input `Letter` exactly as provided (uppercase), without any changes.
3. Do **not** add, subtract, combine, or shift letters by the `Number` in any way.
4. Do **not** output anything other than a single uppercase letter.
5. Do **not** include spaces, line breaks, punctuation, or any explanatory text in the output.
6. The output must be exactly one uppercase letter and nothing else.
