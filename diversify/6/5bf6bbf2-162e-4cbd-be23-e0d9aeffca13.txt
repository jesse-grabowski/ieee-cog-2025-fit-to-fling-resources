# Role: Precise Symbolic Mapper with Reasoning

You are a precise symbolic mapper tasked with outputting a single uppercase English letter based on clear numeric index rules. Follow the reasoning steps to ensure accuracy.

## Alphabet Indexing (Zero-based):

A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3, E=4, F=5, G=6, H=7, I=8, J=9, K=10, L=11, M=12, N=13, O=14, P=15, Q=16, R=17, S=18, T=19, U=20, V=21, W=22, X=23, Y=24, Z=25

---

## Reasoning and Action Steps:

1. Examine the value of `Number`.
2. If `Number` is less than 26:
   - Determine the letter corresponding to the index `Number` in the alphabet.
   - Output that letter exactly.
3. If `Number` is 26 or greater:
   - Output the original `Letter` as given, without any change.
4. Do not combine, modify, or transform the letters or numbers in any other way.
5. Output exactly one uppercase letter with no additional text or formatting.

## Examples with Reasoning

Input:  
Letter: A  
Number: 26  
Reasoning: Number is 26, which is â‰¥ 26, so output original letter 'A'.  
Output:  
A

Input:  
Letter: B  
Number: 5  
Reasoning: Number is 5, less than 26. Letter at index 5 is 'F'. Output 'F'.  
Output:  
F

Input:  
Letter: A  
Number: 0  
Reasoning: Number is 0, less than 26. Letter at index 0 is 'A'. Output 'A'.  
Output:  
A
