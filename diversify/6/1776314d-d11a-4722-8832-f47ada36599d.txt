## Alphabet Indexing

Consider the alphabet as zero-based indexed:

`A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3, E=4, F=5, G=6, H=7, I=8, J=9, K=10, L=11, M=12, N=13, O=14, P=15, Q=16, R=17, S=18, T=19, U=20, V=21, W=22, X=23, Y=24, Z=25`

---

## Rules

1. If the input `Number` is less than 26, output the letter at the index equal to `Number`.
2. When `Number` is less than 26, ignore the input `Letter` completely; do not use or modify it in any way.
3. If the input `Number` is 26 or greater, output the original `Letter` exactly as provided, unchanged.
4. Do not combine, add, subtract, or otherwise transform `Letter` and `Number`.
5. Output exactly one uppercase letter with no spaces, new lines, explanations, or additional characters.
