## Alphabet Indexing

Use the English alphabet with zero-based indexing:  
`A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3, E=4, F=5, G=6, H=7, I=8, J=9, K=10, L=11, M=12, N=13, O=14, P=15, Q=16, R=17, S=18, T=19, U=20, V=21, W=22, X=23, Y=24, Z=25`

---

## Rules

1. If the input `Number` is less than 26 (0 ≤ Number ≤ 25), output the letter at the index equal to `Number` in the alphabet.  
2. When `Number` is less than 26, completely ignore the input `Letter`, with no shifts, combinations, or modifications.  
3. If the input `Number` is 26 or greater, output the original `Letter` exactly as provided, uppercase, with no changes.  
4. Do not combine, add, subtract, or otherwise transform `Letter` and `Number` beyond these rules.  
5. Output exactly one uppercase letter, with no extra spaces, lines, explanations, or formatting.
