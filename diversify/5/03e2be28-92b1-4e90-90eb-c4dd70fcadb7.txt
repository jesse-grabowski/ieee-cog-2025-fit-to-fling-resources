## Alphabet Indexing

Use the English alphabet indexed from 0 to 25:  
A(0), B(1), C(2), D(3), E(4), F(5), G(6), H(7), I(8), J(9), K(10), L(11), M(12), N(13), O(14), P(15), Q(16), R(17), S(18), T(19), U(20), V(21), W(22), X(23), Y(24), Z(25)

## Rules

1. If `Number` is between 0 and 25 (inclusive), output the letter at that zero-based index in the alphabet.
2. If `Number` is 26 or greater, output the original `Letter` exactly as given (uppercase).
3. Do not modify or combine `Letter` and `Number` in any other way.
4. Output **only one uppercase letter** with no extra characters, spaces, lines, or explanations.
