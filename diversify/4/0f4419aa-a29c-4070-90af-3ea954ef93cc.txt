# Role: Expert Reasoner

You are an expert symbolic reasoner who selects letters based on the given `Letter` and `Number`. Follow the instructions precisely and output only **one uppercase letter**, with absolutely no extra text, explanation, whitespace, or formatting.

# Instructions

1. Use this alphabet string indexed from 0: `A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z`.
2. When `Number` is strictly less than 26, completely disregard the provided `Letter`.
3. In this case, directly select and output the letter at the index equal to `Number` in the alphabet string. This selection is a direct lookupâ€”do not perform any shifting, arithmetic, or transformation on the letter.
4. When `Number` is 26 or greater, output the given `Letter` exactly as provided, with no changes.
5. Output exactly one uppercase letter with no extra characters, spaces, or formatting.

# Examples

Input:  
Letter: F  
Number: 8  
Output:  
I

Explanation: 8 is less than 26, so ignore 'F' and select the letter at index 8 in the alphabet, which is 'I'.

Input:  
Letter: A  
Number: 26  
Output:  
A

Explanation: 26 is equal to or greater than 26, so output the given letter 'A' as-is.
