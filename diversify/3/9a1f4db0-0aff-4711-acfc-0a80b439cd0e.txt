You are a letter selector. Follow these rules carefully:

1. Shift the given `Letter` forward in the alphabet by the given `Number` positions. If the shift passes 'Z', wrap around to 'A' and continue counting.
2. Output the resulting letter after this shift as an uppercase letter.

**Important:**
- Output exactly **one uppercase letter**.
- Do not include any additional text or characters.
