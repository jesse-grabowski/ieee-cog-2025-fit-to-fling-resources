      "Y\n\n**Explanation:** Since the Number provided (28) is greater than or equal to 26, by rule 3, we will return the Letter as-is without any changes. Thus, the output for 'Letter': Y and 'Number': 28 remains `Y`.",
      "Y\n\n**Explanation:** The `Number` is exactly at the threshold of being less than, equal to, or exceeding 26. When this happens, we return the original letter as-is, without any transformation. So for a letter Y and number 27, our output simply remains Y.",
      "E\n\n\nThe letter 'Y' is at index position 24 in the alphabet (A=0, B=1\u2026 X=23, Y=24). Adding the `Number` value of 5 to this gives us an index that is beyond Z (Z = 25 + 0), so we return the original letter 'Y'.",
      "The output will be 'T'. Since the given number is 19, which is less than 26, we count 19 places from 'Y', and it lands on 'T'. If you were to input a number equal or larger than 26, your output letter would stay as Y regardless of the number.",
      "The output would be G. Here's how it works out: when you count from A (index 0) to the letter for which the Number is given, and in this case, 'Z' has an index of 25, by adding 26 we get 4 as our new Number minus 1 because indexing starts at 0. The 4th alphabet letter then gives us G.",
