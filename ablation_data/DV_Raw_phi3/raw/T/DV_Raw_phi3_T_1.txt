```
drop_block('b13', 1)
drop_block('b31', 1)
```
To solve this task, we will follow the instructions provided. Let's break down each instruction and apply them to our function call sequence generation. Here is how you can convert the given input:

- We process tokens individually due to rule #2 (separate processing of tokens).
  - `Y1` → `drop_block('b13', 1)` because according to mapping, 'Y' corresponds to 'b13'. The number that follows will map directly onto the position.
  - `Z1` → `drop_block('b31', 1)` based on rule mappings from rule #2.
  
After processing every token and applying special requirements (#6), we'll have the function call sequences following the exact order. The result is a sequence of correctly formatted drop block instructions, which reflect changes made to each original input character:

```
drop_block('b13', 1)
drop_block('b31', 1)
```
