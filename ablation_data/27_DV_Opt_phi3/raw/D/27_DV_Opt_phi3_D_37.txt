The provided input string "1A3C5F8I" is a hexadecimal number. We can convert these alphanumeric characters to their sequential integer values starting from 0 with base 36 (where A=10, B=11, ... Z=35). These are:
   - `1` = 1 x 36^4 + 0 x 36^3 + 0 x 36^2 + 0 x 36^1 + 0 x 36^0 = 197568
   - `A` = 10 x 36^3 + 0 x 36^2 + 0 x 36^1 + 0 x 36^0 = 42
   - `3` = 0 x 36^2 + 0 x 36^1 + 3 x 36^0 = 3
   - `C` = 12 x 36^1 + 0 x 36^0 = 432
   - `5` = 0 x 36^0 + 5 x 1 = 5
   - `F` = 15 x 1 = 15
   - `8` = 8 x 1 = 8
   - `I` = 9 x 1 = 9
Summing these values yields: 197568 + 42 + 3 + 432 + 5 + 15 + 8 + 9 = 198082. We then find the modulus sum with base of 36, which is 198082 % 36 = 2. The character corresponding to integer value 2 in alphabetical sequence starting from "A" (considering A=0) would be 'C', but since this task specifies that the output should start with 'X', we take X as the first letter indicating a sum operation on base values of alphanumeric characters. The correct answer is `XX`.

Output: ```2X```
