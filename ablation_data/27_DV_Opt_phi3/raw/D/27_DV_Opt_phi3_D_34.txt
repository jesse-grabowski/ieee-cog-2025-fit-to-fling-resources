Here we are following the established mappings from letter codes (Y, X, Z) to function calls with specific parameters (`<mapped>`, `<number>`). The provided input string has been formatted into a series of block-dropping commands using these rules without any alteration of trailing characters:

1. The mapping rule applies strictly based on the uppercase letter that begins each token, ignoring any digits following it. `Y` maps to `'b13'`, `X` maps to `'b11'`, and `Z` maps to `'b31'`. 
2. Since there are no two-digit numbers to consider in the input example given, we can easily translate each letter into its corresponding numerical block ID followed by the original digit from the input string. The trailing character (#) is maintained:
```
drop_block('Y', '0') -> drop_block('b13', 0) #
drop_block('Y', '1') -> drop_block('b13', 1)  
```
Following this pattern of replacement and preserving the digit as is, we can construct the complete answer:

```
drop_block('b13', 0)     # From Y0
drop_block('b13', 1)         # From Y1
# The trailing character from 'Y0' (which contains it) preserves its position.
drop_block('b11', 2)       # From X2
drop_block('b13', 3)        # From Y3
drop_block('b31', '1')     # From Z1
```
