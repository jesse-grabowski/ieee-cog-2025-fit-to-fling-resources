# Given Input:
Input:`B`

According to the advanced instructions given for role `Complex Role`:

- Since 'B' maps to the numbered entry (2), we proceed with this information.
- No brackets or ### substrings are specified in a vowel block after letter 'B'. There is no need for binary inversion or ROT13 substitution cipher application here as per step 3 and 4 since these operations apply to specific blocks associated with N to W and A, E, I, O, U respectively.
- According to instruction #5, duplicates are omitted, so if there were instances like "B1|B2", it should be reported only once as "Y1". However, the provided input does not present such a case.
  
Given this role's specific instructions and based on how they apply or don't apply to 'Input: B', we find that there are no additional encoded instructions within its corresponding data block for output according to rule 3, and it's omitted as per instruction #5 due to the given constraints of consecutive duplicate symbols in a non-vowel block.
  
Output:`[[2]]`
