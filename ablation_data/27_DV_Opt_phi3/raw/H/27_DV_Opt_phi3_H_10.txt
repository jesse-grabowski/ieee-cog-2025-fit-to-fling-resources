# Task 1 (Linguistics)
Input: Could you explain Structuralist Linguistics Theory by Ferdinand de Saussure?  
Functionalism Theory in Sociology was proposed by Emile Durkheim. It primarily studies the role of norms and social order in societal maintenance. Functionalism posits that every aspect of society is interdependent and contributes to its overall functioning, with institutions playing functional roles such as integrating individuals into a cohesive unit (through shared values), creating solidarity, facilitating coordination etc., thereby upholding social stability. The theory presents functionality of institutions contributing to this overall functionality and maintaining order – essentially viewing these institutions as serving essential functions like integrating individuals into a cohesive unit (through shared values), creating solidarity, forming perceptions, facilitating the coordination etc.
On the other hand, Marvin Harris' Cultural Materialism in Anthropology adopts an excessively materialist perspective to understanding societal structures and cultural systems – stressing on economic determinism within cultural evolution dynamics; asserting that our social structure is shaped by economy, environment, and mode of subsistence. This approach directly contrasts with Durkheim's Functionalism Theory in Sociology: while functionalism focuses more on symbolic and norm-driven processes to explain societal functionality (i.e., integrating individuals into a cohesive unit through shared values), cultural materialism critiques the prevalent socioeconomic systems' influence within society at large, emphasizing instead how systematic structures are shaped by our resources and mode of exploitation/subsistence – a perspective that directly opposes Durkheim’s focus on normative rules as primary explanatory variables. Both theories offer different frameworks for understanding societal dynamics; with functionalism favoring symbolic and norm-centered analysis, cultural materialism provides an economic determinant critique of the current socioeconomic systems' role in shaping society at large.
