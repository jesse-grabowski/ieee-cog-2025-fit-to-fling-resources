```
Temperature threshold crossing at 200Â°C; Material deformation observed in the tensile test phase initially set to TENSILE-ID=543, with sequential stress points documented up to STEP#78T.
```  

Explanation for Constraints Adherence:
1. Only included entries within material science context (constraint 3).
2. Excluded genome project references that don't follow "Preliminary" phase directly without additional adjectives or qualifiers between (constraint 2; assuming an exclusion based on the criteria given since there are no suitable entries up to M mentioned in this example).  
3. Specific temperature threshold values exceeding standard room conditions, mention 'initial'.
4. Ignored content beyond the letter M inclusively within the data output.
   
(No material property or tensile test phases were identified between letters L and M as per instruction to exclude all content beyond the letter M.)
