For the input `E`, using our database mapping, we find that it corresponds to `"G"` in this context. The mappings for single-digit numbers don't involve any changes based on a condition like the number being greater than or equal to 5 in this case since those rules are meant for two and three digit cases specifically, as per your additional examples given which only concern multi-digit scenarios. Therefore, we apply no conversion to `E` based on the criteria provided in the clarifying example (which doesn't actually affect single digits).

Output:
```
drop_block('b15', 0)
drop_block('b15', 2) #
drop_block('b30', 1)
drop_block('b30', 1)
drop_block('b67', 4) #
drop_block('b68', 5)
drop_block('b91', 0)
drop_block('b28', 0)
drop_block('b27', 1) #
drop_block('b31', 1)
```

Note: Even though the letter `G` isn't among your original example mappings, we inferred its use based on the additional context provided with clarifications and additional examples later in this task.
