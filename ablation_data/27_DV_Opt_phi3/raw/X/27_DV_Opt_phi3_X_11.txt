To ensure effective parsing of structured tokens into function calls within the described block-dropping simulation, follow the steps below:

1. Identify and separate each token using `|` as a delimiter.
2. Apply letter mappings to convert `Y`, `X`, or `Z` into `'b13'`, `'b11'`, or `'b31'` respectively without alteration of the numeric part following the letters in each token.
3. Formulate function calls with the structure `drop_block('<mapped>', <number>)`, where `<number>` includes any combination of one or two digits that follow the initial letter in the input sequence. Preserve any trailing characters in their original form and attach them directly to the respective output line.
4. Write each function call distinctly with proper formatting on a separate newline, maintaining data integrity for both input structure replication and alignment consistency throughout the conversion process.
5. Ensure that all steps are done methodically without alterations or omissions of character codes based on their numeric values to guarantee expected results irrespective of variable complexities in inputs.
6. Return the formatted output ensconced within triple backticks, conforming precisely to syntax highlight rules as provided for optimal readability and accuracy.

By systematically implementing these measures, parse operations across diverse input scenarios can be adeptly managed, affirming adherence to simulation requisites with elevated precision even under high-density data conditions or intricate token formations. The output will embody the correct conversion of identifiable letters into their associated function calls by retaining the crucial details and context specified in the task's requirements.
