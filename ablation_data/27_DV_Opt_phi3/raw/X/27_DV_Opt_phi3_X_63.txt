The given task requires us to handle an input string "SS" and perform a series of transformations to obtain the output based on structured rules. Let's execute this step by step according to the new example provided.

1. Translate 'S' with ASCII code: `83`. Since we're given that `Letter` is an uppercase alphabet, in this case, it's 'S'. So instead of directly converting each 'S', as per the modified task instruction, let's maintain the representation and keep them as they are.
   
   As a result: "SS".

2. The second step of the new example involves performing arithmetic operations on these characters but based on the given instructions ("...the sum of the numerical ASCII values"), there is no need for division or modulo calculations to switch alphabets because 'S' doesn't qualify for any range modifications based on Rule #6. However, since the task now explicitly asks us to consider ASCII codes and do an addition (but only when needed), letâ€™s proceed with it just as a demonstrative purpose rather than necessity from this specific rule set:
   
   Hence, `83 + 83` = `166`. This falls outside our typical value categories' range or any mentioned operations like modulo since the given task emphasizes string representation rather than numeric manipulation in selecting new letters. Thus no alphabetical shift will occur based on this sum according to these instructions.
   
   Considering we maintain characters as is, with their ASCII code representation being part of a demonstration: "`83 83`". Notice that while the added step technically alters the input's appearance numerically (showcasing its ASCII values), it doesn't affect our final output pertaining to alphabetic letter selection or direct transformation, keeping in line with preserving their initial format.
   
However, if we were solely focusing on converting based on the rules outlined for character manipulation and transformations (as seen in earlier examples), recognizing this task's emphasis adjustment from the initially described set of instructions alters how 'SS' is processed. Originally intended as a demonstration to showcase ASCII values, it now primarily focuses on directly reflecting characters with their numerical codes, which in practice remains static given the new execution context:

Output: ```
83 83 #
```
