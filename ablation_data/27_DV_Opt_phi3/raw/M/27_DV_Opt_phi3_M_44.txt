Here's the output following your instructions for the given input "Letter H and numbers 28":

Input format is assumed to be `H letter[space][number]`, where H stands for "Header" indicating that it precedes the actual transformation sequence. The "letter" would correspond to its numeric representation from an implicit database, and the number provided at the end indicates how many times this process should repeat or if another operation should take place on this string afterward (which is not clear without further context). However, since we're only focusing on the transformation sequence itself:
```
Y27|X4 #|Y0|Z1|Y6|Z5 28
```
