```python
drop_block('b31', '')
```

This follows the guideline that a token consisting exclusively of a single uppercase letter from `A` to `Z` is directly converted without modification, as per instruction #2. Furthermore, since there are no digits present in this one-letter token (token 'Z'), we follow rule 3 where `'b11'`, `'b13'` and `'b31'` represent specific block IDs for the letters `X`, `Y` and `Z` respectively. However, as per instruction #4, function calls should be provided with a number after each block ID mapped from letter tokens; but since there are no accompanying digits here, we map 'Z' to `'b31'` with an empty string representing the absence of numbers.  There arenâ€™t any trailing characters attached since it is also lacking that in this context; hence preserving its exact input form while complying with instruction #5 by maintaining alignment and treating spaces or additional characters (if any) properly according to their placement relative to the converted block IDs.
