``t#erraurunnil#v`````

Explanation: The phrase 'v#ulnirra#et#3' undergoes a reverse translation as per the '#5' rule, resulting in `e##ret#lnirnu#t`. Decoding this according to the special rules we have for vowels and consonants encoded distinctly, and sequences of three or more vowels translating into 'vulneratiem', we get:

- The reverse translation is not required here as there's no '#5' in our case.
 
- There isn't a specific sequence for Latin phrases within the given input codex guidelines, so skip this step.

Next, translating based on the hash symbol denoting punctuation: in `##ret`, since we only deal with lowercase symbols (ignoring other exceptions here), the '#' does not indicate a punctuation mark or uppercase conversion as per our added instructionsâ€”this should remain lowercase without any upper case translation.
 
Therefore, using 'vulnirra' and ignoring the ambiguous special character `3` since it doesn't map to anything given the additional constraints aren't specified here:

Decoded phrase: ``````The rain er...``` (wherever "er..." translates from "et#3") ``````
