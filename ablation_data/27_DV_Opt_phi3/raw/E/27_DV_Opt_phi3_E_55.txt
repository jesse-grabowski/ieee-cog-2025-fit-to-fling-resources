```python
drop_block('b31', 1)
drop_block('b13', 0)
drop_block('b13', 1) #
drop_block('b31', 1)
drop_block('b11', 0)
drop_block('b11', 1)
```

This output is generated by following the given instructions precisely. The input string "Z1|Y0|Y1 #|Z1|X0|X1|Z1" contains six tokens, and each one must be converted as per the mappings provided:

- `Z1` becomes `drop_block('b31', 1)`
- `Y0` becomes `drop_block('b13', 0)` for block label 'b13' + number 0 appended at the end (token is `Y0`). There are no trailing characters, so nothing follows on a new line. It remains part of this line in output form.
- `Y1` becomes `drop_block('b13', 1)` for block label 'b13' + number 1 appended at the end (token is `Y1`). Similar to Y0, there are no trailing characters and thus nothing else follows on a new line according to rules.
- `#|Z1` becomes an empty token as it should be ignored based on instructions provided, therefore not included in output.
- The next three tokens follow the same mapping and formatting principles as above (i.e., `b31`, `b11`; `Z11`, `X0`), but there is a space before `#` that gets preserved directly after the function call on this line to maintain alignment with the input token:
```python
drop_block('b31', 1) # 
```
