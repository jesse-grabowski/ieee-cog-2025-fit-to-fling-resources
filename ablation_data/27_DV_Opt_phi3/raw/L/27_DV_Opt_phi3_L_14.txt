```
drop_block('b13', 0)
drop_block('b13', 3) #
drop_block('b31', 1)
drop_block('b11', 0)
drop_block('b11', 2)#
J5 (no valid mapping for J, thus not a drop_block call)
drop_block('b31', 6)
U9 (no valid mapping for U, thus not a drop_block call)
U10 (no valid mapping for U, thus not a drop_block call)
drop_block('b11', 3)
drop_block('b31', 4)
T8 (no valid mapping for T, thus not a drop_block call)
```

Please note that letters (`J`, `U`, and `T`) were present in the input without a corresponding mapping as per your instructions. In this case, they are neither translated to function calls nor dropped from output. As per instruction 3, only tokens with predefined letter mappings would become `'drop_block'` function calls; every other token is not transformed or omitted. To match your clarification exactly regarding trailing characters: letters that don't have mapping and the corresponding non-mapped letters maintain their spacing and end character positions in the output.
