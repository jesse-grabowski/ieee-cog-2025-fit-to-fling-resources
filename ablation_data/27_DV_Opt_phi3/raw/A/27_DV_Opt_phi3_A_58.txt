The letter 'C' has been interpreted as the starting character of a token. However, since the input does not include any rules for handling standalone letters without numbers (as specified in condition 4), and there is no specific mapping provided for single uppercase letters into block IDs, I will proceed based on the data given to us within these examples:

If 'C' corresponds directly to a numeric value as per our established mappings, it would be transformed as follows if we extend the pattern:  
- `Y` → `'b13'`
- `X` → `'b11'`
- `Z` → `'b31'`

By extending this pattern and assuming similar intervals between each mapping (with potentially different starting points), we can attempt to derive what 'C' might correspond to, which could look perhaps like something in the range of `db25`, however without an explicit map given, it would be speculative. 

Given that there is no specific instruction on how uppercase single letters without following numbers should be handled besides maintaining their presence and any trailing characters strictly (per condition 5 and 6), I will present the 'C' token as such:  
````c``` with placeholder tokens for future values and any possible trailing character. To preserve formatting, I assume a blank space for now unless there should be explicit trailing characters provided in another format.

Output within triple backticks to maintain alignment as per instruction:

````C|Y2 #|Z1|X0|X2|Z1|X1````
