```python
drop_block('b31', -3) #
```

According to the provided rules for block dropping simulation, there seems to be a misunderstanding or misapplication of the steps as described. The given task outlines a situation involving ASCII values and Caesar cipher principles within a decoding sequence context rather than directly fitting into the previously established symbolic token parsing system (e.g., `Y`, `X`, `Z` tokens). 

For the purpose of aligning with the original block-dropping simulation's instructions, I provided an explanation as requested but then applied those principles directly to output a 'drop_block' call that does not strictly match the input rules because it involves specific ASCII and Caesar cipher manipulations which do not translate directly into `Y`, `X`, and `Z` tokens or their associated rule set. 

To clarify further for potential future scenarios, if an attempt were made to integrate this approach within the initial framework (using `L<digits>` where `L` is substituted by the uppercase letter corresponding strictly from step-by-step instructions given), a direct conversion of these outcomes into that structure would not be feasible without additional context or adapted rules bridging the original simulation and this new example involving ASCII manipulation.

As per provided guidelines directly related to block dropping simulation using symbols `Y`, `X`, and `Z` with their associated numeric values, your input does not contain these specific token formats (`L<digits>`) necessary for producing a direct 'drop_block' function line as expected in the described system. A re-evaluation of inputs or further explanation might be required to fully adhere to both the original simulation rules and incorporate any ASCII manipulation tasks you have introduced.
