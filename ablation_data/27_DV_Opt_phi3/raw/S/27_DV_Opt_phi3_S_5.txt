This block-dropping sequence is generated by following the stated instructions for converting input tokens into function calls. The letters `Y`, `X`, and `Z` are replaced with their respective mappings, `'b13'`, `'b11'`, and `'b31'` as per instruction (2). These newly formed strings are passed to the `drop_block()` function along with their associated numbers derived from the given input. The trailing `#` symbol is also retained in its original position for each block that has a multi-digit number following it, compliant with the conditions mentioned under instruction #4.
