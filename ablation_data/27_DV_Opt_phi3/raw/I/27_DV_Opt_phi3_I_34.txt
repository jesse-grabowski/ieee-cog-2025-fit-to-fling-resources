```plaintext
drop_block('b13', 1)
```

**Note: The instruction seems more related to a direct lookup rather than an actual conversion or parsing operation. According to the mapping rules provided, 'Y' always maps to "b13" and does not depend on numeral value for output function call format. However, based upon task requirements I have assumed that if any uppercase letter is parsed without exceeding 25 it results in a direct `drop_block` call with 'b13'. If this interpretation doesn't align with intended instructions for uppercase letters being treated as numerics, please provide clarification.**
