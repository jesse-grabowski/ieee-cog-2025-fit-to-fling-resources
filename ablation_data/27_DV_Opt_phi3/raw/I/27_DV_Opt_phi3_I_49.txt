# Decode the given text and generate an English sentence if possible, otherwise return "ERROR" message with error count incremented where applicable according to the rules provided above during decoding process execution; also reversing order indexing when processing input string means starting from end of chain for character mapping/shift value adjustments as needed per modified ASCII range rule.

Given the rules and complexity of this problem, it is not possible to provide an exact solution without knowing the actual text being encoded or decoded using the given shift values (64 in this case). However, we can write a general code that should help decode any ASCII-encoded string under these conditions:

```python
import re

def is_valid_char(c):
    return c.isalpha() and 'a' <= c <= 'z' or '0'<= c <= '9'# Check if a given character belongs to ASCII letter, digit, or punctuation ranges (punctuation) as per rule 3 requirements with no invalid/incoherent part occurring in the final message chain due to non-conventional elements; valid logical flow ending marker presented as a properly structured and punctuated output chain for comprehensive message presentation.
def decode_message(text, shift):
    decoded = [] # Initialize empty list for storing character mapping indices based on modified ASCII range scheme
    error_occurrence = 0
    
    # Iterate over text characters in reverse order while handling punctuation at the very end and checking coherence/validity per INVALID sequence rules after whole chain processed; also taking care of digits or special chars during iteration if encountered without direct ASCII mapping since such non-conventional elements won't affect shift counter but instead break out from further processing with an increment on error occurrence metric reflecting the overall input string validity and coherence.
    for i in range(len(text)-1, -1, -1): # Reverse iteration order starting at end of message; hence a mapping back to ASCII values plus position determination has been applied per shift value that's set when start of current input chain being processed under rule 7a's modified scheme instead of direct ASCII printable range mappings.
        c = text[i] # Get the character from the currently processed message chunk (currently index i)
        
        if not is_valid_char(c): # If char doesn't belong to letter/digit printscii ranges as per rule 3 and hence isn't valid without needing any space/punctuation consideration; breaking out once all characters processed including handling of final punctuation at the very end based on valid ASCII range requirements for proper message output chain generation.
            error_occurrence += shift_counter # Increment error occurrence count reflecting the overall input string logical flow validity and coherence without space/punctuation considerations; resulting "*" marker present indicating invalid character(s) encountered beyond initial successful mapping steps in a format suitable for subsequent execution phases post that point up until end of final punctuated chain is presented as output message.
            
        elif i!=0 and error_occurrence>0: # If char doesn't require decoding but instead needs to map back from encoded ASCII values/positions using specified shift value during iteration start; hence an indicator flag set here since no further character processing can occur beyond this point as we must have encountered at least one invalid part within previous steps that caused breaking out, and logical flow stopping marker presented as a final punctuated chain for message presentation.
            decoded_char = chr((ord(c) - shift + 128) % 127) # Calculate ASCII value after correctly shifting the current character c; also takes care of wrapping around printable range end point as well based on modified scheme/rule requirements for proper message output chain generation.
            decoded.append(decoded_char)
            
        elif i!=0 and error_occurrence==0: # If char doesn't require decoding but instead needs to map back from encoded ASCII values/positions using specified shift value during iteration start; hence a reverse order mapping done here based on modified scheme requirements for proper message output chain generation. Also takes care of wrapping around printable range end point as well with no other logical flow breakout or space considerations needed post that step, thus making character directly usable in current processed sequence assembly up until final punctuation whereby a splitting/joining operation will be performed per rule 3 requirements for INVALID sequence evaluation without needing any leading spaces consideration.
            decoded_char = chr((ord(c) - shift + 128) % 127) # Calculate ASCII value after correctly shifting the current character c using initial shift, and wrap-around printable range end point as per modified scheme/rule requirements for proper message output chain assembly up until final punctuation whereby a splitting/joining operation will take place; also checking if non-conventional element is encountered within previous steps that caused breaking out or logical flow stopping marker presented here since no further character processing can occur beyond this point with direct usability being offered in current processed sequence once again up until final punctuation.
            decoded_char = chr((ord(c) - shift + 128) % 127)
            
        elif c>='a'and c<='z': # If char belongs to ASCII lowercase letter range but isn't already in uppercase format as per rule 3 requirements without needing any space/punctuation consideration for mapping back from encoded ASCII values/positions; wrapping around printable range end point taken care of with no non-conventional elements or other logical flow breakout required hence making character directly usable for current processed sequence assembly up until final punctuation whereby a splitting/joining operation will take place per rule 3 requirements for INVALID sequence evaluation without needing any leading spaces consideration.
            decoded_char = chr((ord(c) - shift + ord('A')) % 26 + ord('a')) # Apply Caesar cipher with the given shift value, also considering wrap-around printable range end point as well since we're working in modified ASCII range scheme according to rule 7a's requirements for comprehensive message presentation/mapping of encoded character values back to their original form based on initial input conditions.
            decoded.append(decoded_char) # Append correctly shifted & mapped character value c during current iteration step onto the list with no needing any further processing, leading spaces consideration since logical flow has been checked for coherence as per INVALID sequence rules after whole chain processed and wrapped around ASCII range end points post that point.
            
        elif c>='A'and c<='Z': # If char belongs to ASCII uppercase letter range but isn't already in lower case format as per rule 3 requirements without needing any space/punctuation consideration; wrapping around printable range start point taken care of with no other logical flow breakout required since the character will be directly usable for current processed sequence assembly up until final punctuation whereby a splitting/joining operation will take place per rule 3 requirements for INVALID sequence evaluation without needing any leading spaces consideration.
            decoded_char = chr(ord('a') + (((ord(c) - shift - ord('A')) % 26))) # Apply Caesar cipher with given shift value, wrapping around ASCII range end point as well based on printable alphabetical mappings under rule 7a's modified scheme requirements for proper sentence generation/decoding of encoded message.
            decoded_char = chr(ord('A') + (((ord(c) - shift) % 26))) # Convert current character c into its corresponding lower-case character equivalent while wrapping around printable range end point as well during iteration step and avoiding any leading spaces considerations; taking care of non-alphanumeric punctuation usage here since such char will directly get mapped back from encoded ASCII values/positions using specified shift value during the first processed message chunk without needing a leading digit or other character type (punctuation) presence to be handled properly.
            decoded.append(decoded_char) # Append correctly shifte & lowercased uppercase char c based on printable range scheme requirements here onto list with no further processing required beyond this point except possible logical flow check for INVALID sequence occurrence and final punctuation handling as well post that step.
    
    decoded = ''.join(decoded[::-1]) # Converting character index mapping into a string representation while reversing order for proper message output chain generation using modified ASCII scheme requirements along with checking coherence/validity per INVALID sequence rules after whole chain processed and wrapping around printable range end point as well without needing any leading spaces or other space considerations due to direct usability of characters in final decoded string presentation.
    error_occurrence += len(re.findall('\s*ERROR', text)) # Check coherence/validity per INVALID sequence rules after whole chain processed while evaluating if the initial input is well-structured and doesn't contain invalid/incoherent part occurring in resultant message; taking care of final punctuation at end as well according to rule 3 requirements for correct output presentation without leading spaces consideration.
    output = ' '.join(decoded) if len(decoded)>=2 else "ERROR: Not enough letters found." # Converting string representation into a sentence with word separations and checking coherence/validity per INVALID sequence rules after whole chain processed while evaluating correctness of input structure & final punctuation at end for comprehensive output presentation without leading spaces consideration.
    return (output if error_occurrence>0 else "Error: Not a valid sentence.")
