The original input provided is related to a block-dropping simulation parsing task rather than the decryption output for an encoded message such as "ABXCAOXXZJAXXXEELM" with conditions CipherShift = False and Anomaly = True. However, assuming we need assistance in understanding that particular problem scenario despite the discrepancy between input nature (a string of tokens) and provided example (decryption request), I'll give you an analysis based on common decryption methods such as Caesar ciphers or substitution ciphers under specific conditions.

Given CipherShift = False, we rule out simple Caesar ciphers where the letters are shifted in the alphabet by a fixed number each time (since no shift value is provided). Similarly, Anomaly = True implies there might be deviation from any standard pattern or unexpected manipulation of the cipher process.

One method to explore could involve an XOR operation if we assume binary representation and 'C' as output which requires reversing back. But without details on keys or specific encryption techniques used, it is infeasible to decrypt accurately. If you have more context—like the original language of the message, frequency analysis results, common encoding pitfalls present within known languages (e.g., 'E' being a frequent vowel)—providing clarity may lead to a more educated hypothesis on why certain letters became encoded as 'C'.

Remember that for encrypted messages, one typically needs either direct knowledge of the encryption method or sufficient parts of the original message and ciphertext to reverse-engineer it. Without additional information on pattern deviations (hinting at an "Anomaly"), exact rules applied in this scenario remain ambiguous.
