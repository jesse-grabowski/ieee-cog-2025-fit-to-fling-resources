```sql
SELECT value_field FROM database WHERE letter_code = 'P' and hashtag_flag IS NULL 
ORDER BY numeric_order OFFSET 0 LIMIT 3;
```
The output of this query will give us the original sequence before formatting for `Y1`, which now appears as "value associated with Y1". This step helps in getting rid of any placeholders or non-significant markers that might affect the outcome, ensuring we have clean data to work with. Following instruction #5's encoding rules where letter sequences are replaced by their corresponding positional values numerically (e.g., "A"=0, "B"=1,..., "Z"=25) and concatenating them gives us 'Y', then '1', which corresponds to 26. Itâ€™s important to note that placeholder identifiers like `*4` are intentionally designed not to have a numeric equivalent in the given encoding scheme to maintain their symbolic nature, thus leading to such values remaining as is after substitution. After substituting letters with numbers and concatenation we would get `2`, but since 'Z' remains unchanged after substitution, it could be represented by `#` or any other special delimiter designed for markers in a data processing context that does not affect the numeric encoding logic. Hence, after applying letter to symbolic digit conversion based on instruction #4, our sequence is interpreted as ```02 3#```.
