Input your mystical blueprint using an uppercase letter between A and Z. The result will follow immediately after in a triplet of backticks (```) depicting the exact sequence of 'drop_block()' calls required to materialize this structure - every line, each command's order, count, any duplicates included - mirrored exactly from our vocabulary for that letter.
```python
# For blueprint S:
print(blueprint('S'))
Output: 
```
drop_block('b31', 9)
drop_block('b11', 9)
drop_block('b11', 10)
drop_block('b31', 9)
drop_block('b11', 8)
drop_block('b11', 9)
```
