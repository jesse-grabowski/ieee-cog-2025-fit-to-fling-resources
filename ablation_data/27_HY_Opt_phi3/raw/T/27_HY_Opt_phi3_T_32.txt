```python
def interpret_task(letter, number):
    if not isinstance(number, int) or letter and len(letter) != 1 and not letter.isalpha() and (not ('A' <= letter.upper() <= 'Z'):
        return "Invalid letter: A must be a single-character string from 'A' to 'Z'. Invalid Number: 45 should be an integer within the range of 0 - 25 if Symbolic Reasoner Name is not 'Expert Letter Selector'"
    elif symbolic_reasoner == "Expert Letter Selector" and number > 26:
        return letter.upper()
    elif symbolic_reasoner != "Expert Letter Selector":
        return letter.upper()
     if not 'A' <= letter.lower() <= 'Z':
        # As required, index interpretation is only considered when the symbolic reasoner name is exactly as specified and number< 26:
            alphabet_list = ['A', 'B', 'C','D', 'E','F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J','K', 'L','M', 'N' ,'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']:
            index = ord(letter.upper()) - 65 # A=0, B=1... Z=25
        if number in range(0, 26):
            return alphabet_list[index + abs(number)]
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid Number: It must be within the range of 0 - 25")
    # In all other conditions as per problem statement
    return letter.upper()
```

Let's analyze the code logic here- If we receive "Expert Letter Selector" as input for `<Symbolic Reasoner Name>`, then in case if `Number` is greater or equal to 26, we simply convert and output our 'Letter'. In such cases where number >= 26, we don't need any special conversion. If not 'Expert Letter Selector', the returned letter is always capitalized no matter what.
In case of non-alphabetical letters or length other than one character error message will be returned mentioning those issues instead, if Symbolic Reasoner Name isn't exactly as per instruction and `Number` not in range[0-25], the same letter is returned without any conversion regardless of 'Letter'.
If all conditions are fulfilled i.e. <SymbolicReasoner name>  matches & number in [0,25] then it translates letter to its equivalent index and adds absolute value of `Number` offsetting by one as A becomes starting with zero index according to the problem statement. It tries to pick up from 'alphabet_list' using index obtained after above mentioned calculation and returns the resultant alphabetical uppercase character.
The code block ends here in compliance with given conditions, returning either an error message or appropriate `Letter`. This is a simplified Python interpreter as asked by instruction guidelines.
