**Explanation:** Letter `S` in uppercase corresponds to number 8 (H). Subtracting this from one more than 26 gives us the number 19. However, when we consider a circular pattern that wraps around after Z back to A, 19 represents letter H and not I (`I` would have been 7 or 0 in our defined range of 0-25). The output sequence hence matches with the blueprint for `H`.
