For this more complex scenario in a follow-up question for Instruction 2, suppose we were given the following array of inputs to be processed individually according to our specified rules from Instruction 2 without additional constraints: `[('J', 0), ('S', 58)]`. Here are the detailed analyses and responses as per each rule.

```txt
Sequence: [('J', 0), ('S', 58)]
```

The first tuple, `('J', 0)`, would be processed according to Rule 2 which states that for any character such that its mapped number is less than 25; the output should be `'A'`. Since in this case we do not have additional constraints or a mapping of J -> X and hence it falls within our specified range. So, using `'J', 0` we find what letter corresponds to having `number =<25`, thus giving us an encoded character 'A'.

The second tuple is `('S', 58)`, here the number far exceeds the limit of the English alphabet which has its own cycle from A(which starts at index 0) through Z as a 26-character set. When applying Rule 3 in conjunction, since `'number > 25 + index_of_S' (18), and S starts with the number 19 by this rule we simply return `letter` unaltered which is 'S'.

The final concatenated output for this sequence would be a string composed of our processed characters without any separators, as per Instruction from the original task. So, based upon the input `[(J, 0), (S, 58)]`, we have:
```
AS
```

Now let's move on to question three where we need an indexed system but with additional conditions that follow up questions often carry for clarity purposes: Mapping back onto an indexed starting at 0 to 25 and assuming any index out of range is marked as 'X'. For the first tuple from our given sequence, `('J', 0)` becomes `(J, A=7)` because indexing starts with A = 0. However, for 'S' (`index_of_S` is 18), adding it to a number that falls outside allowed range, such as in `number > 25 + index_of_S`, gives us an index out of the given bounds (e.g., when we had attempted to process `'J', 35`), since there's no positive result within our alphabet cycle, S cannot be translated properly and thus would be marked 'X'.

The final output with these conditions applied for the array `[('J', 0), ('S', 58)]`, therefore would be:
```
(A, J) (X, S)
```

This reflects that 'J' maps to index 7 properly translating back from `'A'` but 'S' can not fall within our given bounds if we consider any number more than `let = 25 + index_of_char`, hence it is marked as invalid with an 'X'.
