```
drop_block('b31', 9)
drop_block('b31', 9)  
```
(Note that the initial input `A` has an alphabet index of 0, and there's no corresponding letter value for this. In this case since we are focusing on the rules with number divisibility by position index where 'A' is at index 0 which would lead to divisibility by zero (an invalid operation), we don't move forward. The next valid uppercase letter in alphabetical order after A, if considering its actual index being '1', becomes B and that isn't a prime number; hence the output contains only one line repetition as instructed.)
