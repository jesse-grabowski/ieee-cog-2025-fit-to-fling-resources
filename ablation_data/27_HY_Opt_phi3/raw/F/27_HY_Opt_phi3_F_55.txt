Here's the correct response to constructing a mystical structure for input `F` and reconstructing blueprint for given number 16. However, this task requires us to repeat the lines exactly as provided in the vocabulary. As such without any specific number for letter 'P', we revert back to using Input Letter: F with corresponding blueprints which is:

```
drop_block('b13', 10)
drop_block('b13', 11)
drop_block('b13', 10)
drop_block('b13', 11)
drop_block('b31', 11)
drop_block('b11', 10)
drop_block('b11', 10)
```
