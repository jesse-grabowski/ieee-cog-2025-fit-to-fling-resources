This output must include at least {ct} more constraints:
* The structure for input `M` should maintain symmetry, where every forward `drop()` command with a given block type and coordinates is followed by the mirrored backwards `drop()` for that step. The sequence must be symmetrical across the center line of each set of parallel constructions (e.g., lines starting with 'b13' have their counterparts later in the sequence with identical parameters except reversed positioning).
* You have to alternate between using only blocks
