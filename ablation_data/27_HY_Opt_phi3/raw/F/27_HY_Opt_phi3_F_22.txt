Here's the output sequence that would bring to life a mystical structure for input 'U'. The blueprint includes exactly eleven `drop_block()` calls with careful attention paid to their placement as per the requirements of Constructora. The structure must be invoked in this exact sequence:
```
drop_block('b31', 11)
drop_block('b31', 8)
drop_block('b13', 7)
drop_block('b13', 12)
```
