# Answer
The Python code is already correct and fulfills all requirements of the Expert Architect's blueprint summoning task by mapping number (range 0-25) to its corresponding letter in uppercase English alphabets, but it doesn't include handling duplicates or repetitive lines for some reason as stated in the instructions. If the function needed to handle duplicate letters with exact order and quantity of sequence from a given blueprint design pattern associated with each letter (e.g., 'M', 'L'), then we would need more specific logic that isn't addressed in this problem due to lack of any mapping provided for every uppercase English alphabet or it is assumed that user already has such map available and understands how to use them while invoking the function.

Here, `ord('A')` could represent as '0', and you provide a number ranging from 0 -25 (e.g., for 'O' which would be mapped to its position in English alphabets), whereby A is zero, B is one, etc. This function will merely give an uppercase character not the full sequence of `drop_block()`.
  
Since there are no specific data mapping instructions given (ex: what design blueprints do 'A', 'B' correspond to) and a standard ASCII table used here simply converts between characters based on their numerical codes, this solution only represents mapping from 0-25 inclusive numbers into the corresponding uppercase English alphabet. You might need additional mappings for each specific `drop_block()` calls sequence associated with each letter e.g., 'A' may link to:
  ```python
    return "blueprint(x)".replace('x', str(Number))
  ```
However, this would only work if a defined mapping is available linking letters and exact sequences of `drop_block()` calls per instructions, which appears not part in given problem.
