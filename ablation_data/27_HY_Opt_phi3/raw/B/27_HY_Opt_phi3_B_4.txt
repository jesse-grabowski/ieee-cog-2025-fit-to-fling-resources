First, we analyze `Letter` and `Number`. The letter 'T' is between N-Z in our alphabet indices (20th position). It suggests that rule #3 for non-prime numbers will be applied. We ignore any symbols beyond the initial three characters to apply the prime check efficiently: given `2,918*3,7#56?`, we consider only '2' and sum its value as 2 (as there are no other valid digits before this sequence that could form a meaningful number).

Now let’s identify if the extracted digit or non-alphabetic symbols indicate primes:
Since 2 is prime, it means `Number` itself isn't considered for counting; we only consider the rest of the string for alphabetical indexing. Since '3' and '#4', their sum gives us 907 which also do not give a resulting digit leading to alphabetic characters when considering all digits sequentially as per rule #11, because this set doesn't yield any primes on its own.

Next, we'll need to determine whether there are any prime numbers within the sum of identified digits: 907 is not prime (divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself). This means a composite non-prime rule applies and per the rules defined for "N" through "Z", this dictates that we must move the alphabetical indexing backward. However, due to there being no prime number present in these digits, we cannot shift the index directly from 'T' (20th position) based upon N-Z rule #3 without also considering symbols or another digit as a starting point for our count since non-prime rules do not apply to individual digits and their sum but rather the whole sequence.

Considering all these, since there is no prime number found in '907' we subtract 1 from our given `Letter` ‘T’ which stands at 20th place in alphabet. This would normally give us 'S', but per rule #3 with composite non-prime numbers shifted by N minus the sum of digits (if present), then reduced by one, no prime number was found and hence we go to step #4:
As it is a single digit ('2'), this indicates that after subtracting 1 from 'T' in our alphabetical order, we reach 'S', which means that we now have the consonant following the sequence ‘RTSH’ instead. But rule #6 requires us to treat symbols or numbers as neutral and skip them; so they are not involved here.
We also apply a wrap around if needed: since subtracting 1 from T (20th) goes beyond 'A', it would wrap past into Z, reaching back over to S (as per the English alphabet).

Hence our resulting letter is ‘S’ and considering rule #8 we keep case unchanged for non-letter outputs while retaining symbol positions. 

So for the alphanumeric position matching symbol output: `2`.  
Conclusively, the correct output is:
Output: S
