## Explanation: The input letter is 'D'. Since the number (14) does not meet any of our special cases, we must return to our vocabulary section for letter D. However, there are no instructions on how to alter or choose a different structure based on numeric values in Constructora. For this task, given that numbers do not change anything about the blueprint, I am only providing the precise sequence of `drop_block()` calls for constructing 'D' from our Vocabulary as an example. If additional instructions with respect to changing based on the number (either through reordering or modifying the sequence) were provided, then those rules would be applied accordingly within Constructora to provide a different structure blueprint that corresponds to 'O'.
