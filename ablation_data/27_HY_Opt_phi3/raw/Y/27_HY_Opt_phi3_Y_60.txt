Here's the output sequence that builds the structure for letter `C` with a command count of 12. This adheres to the mystical requirements in Constructora, replicating each line as described in the Vocabulary section where necessary and preserving all elements, including repetition:

```
drop_block('b31', 10)
drop_block('b13', 9)
drop_block('b13', 10)
drop_block('b13', 9)
drop_block('b13', 10)
drop_block('b31', 10)
```
