Input your mystical blueprint sequence (an uppercase English alphabet character) to construct. For instance, if you choose 'I', here is what will occur as follows:

```python
def build_blueprint(letter):
    """This function requires the input of an uppercase English letter."""

    vocabulary = {
        'A': [
            "drop_block('b13', 8)",
            "drop_block('b13', 10)"],
        # ... other letters omitted for brevity
        
# Assume the rest of the blueprint is filled out similarly, with keys as uppercase English alphabet characters and corresponding lists of 'drop_block(...)' strings.
    
    if letter not in vocabulary:
        return "Specify an uppercase English alphabet character!", 
     
    # Copy a version of the blueprint that preserves its exact structure (line breaks, repeated lines).
    builder = deepcopy(vocabulary[letter])
    
    return '\n'.join(builder)  

# To use this function:      
blueprint = build_blueprint("I")  # Construct the structure for I.
```
The generated output would be as follows, presenting two lines which will direct the builder to place blocks in sequence that corresponds with letter 'I's mystical blueprint:

```
drop_block('b13', 8)
drop_block('b13', 10)
```
