In Brazil's case, 'Global Carbon Emission Trends' data indicates agriculture constitutes about 6% of the country’s GDP growth contribution. If deforestation rates rise by 10%, it would exacerbate issues like soil erosion and reduction in arable land due to Amazonian rainforest degradation. Considering Brazil's significant reliance on agricultural exports – particularly soybeans which is highly impacted, we can anticipate this sector’s growth rate might decline by 0.3%. Concurrently, forestry output could dip by around 0.2%, with a ripple effect of reducing the GDP's contribution from these sectors by an estimated $2 billion per year due to lower yields and potential sanctions from carbon-sensitive trading partners. Given historical economic stability, we would potentially see Brazil’s current Q1 growth projection of 3.5% decrease down to approximately 2.8%. This hypothetical scenario presumes continued international pressures concerning environmental policies remain consistent over the next two fiscal quarters. It must be noted that this forecast is subjective and dependent on constant trade relations, as significant sanctions could amplify GDP deterioration beyond these initial projections.
