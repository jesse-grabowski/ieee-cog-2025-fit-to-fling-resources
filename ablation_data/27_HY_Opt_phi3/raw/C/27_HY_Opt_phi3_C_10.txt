```
drop_block('b11', 8)
drop_block('b13', 10)
drop_block('b11', 8)
drop_block('b13', 11)
```
The input is C, which means we need the blueprint for C in our Vocabulary section. For C, the output sequence includes `drop_block(b11, 8)`, then `drop_block(b13, 10)` twice as per the given Vocabulary pattern. Since each line is executed once and no line repeats in our blueprint for C with these parameters, we write out those exact calls to construct block J according to the ancient traditions of Constructora.
