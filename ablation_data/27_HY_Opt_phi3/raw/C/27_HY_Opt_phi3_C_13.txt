```drop_block('b31', 10)
drop_block('b11', 9)
drop_block('b11', 10)
drop_block('b31', 10)
```  

The response to the above input '2' which is actually for the letter 'C' (given its index in the English alphabet plus the number), would bring forth a structure that aligns with our mystical blueprint, and here it is:

```drop_block('b13', 5)
drop_block('b13', 6)
drop_block('b13', 8)
drop_block('b13', 10)
drop_block('b13', 11)
```
Notice how this structure doesnâ€™t directly translate back to the letter `O`. This discrepancy exists because each mystical blueprint corresponds to an English alphabet character, yet also maintains its unique numeric identifier and block calling pattern.
