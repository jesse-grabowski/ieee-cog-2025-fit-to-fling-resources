M based on the reversed alphabetic index considering rule #2, which translates this number (101 is not a Fibonacci nor a prime) to its corresponding letter as if counting in reverse from Z=1 downward. The ordinal position of 'M' after applying these operations would be 7; therefore, the output will reflect B because B corresponds to index 2 in this reversed order set (with A being last and M before it).
