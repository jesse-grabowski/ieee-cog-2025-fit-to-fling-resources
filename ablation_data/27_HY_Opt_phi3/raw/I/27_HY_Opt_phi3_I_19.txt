This task builds upon the prior instructions by adding more intricate logical conditions. Follow these steps to synthesize the required output list from the given datasets with attention to each detail outlined in your expanded instructions:  
- The first dataset `Date` is an array of dates ranging within any one calendar year without specifying which, where dates are formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD".  
2. Alongside this are temperature readings for each corresponding date given as a list of integers representing the average daily temperatures in millibar units (mb). This means you must account not only for Fahrenheit changes but now also convert from millibars to Fahrenheit using the provided conversion formula: `m_degF = 10(millibars) - 5`.  
4. Base temperature, unlike prior tasks where it was a constant integer across several inputs within one session, is unique for every input set and given by `(Base Date's average millibar reading divided by the number of entries in 'Temperature' list); you should calculate this base value yourself without assuming previous sets have had identical values.
5. For each date, perform an analysis to check if there has been a temperature increase or decrease compared to both the preceding and following dates; however, now only consider triplets (three consecutive dates) where none of the three includes weekends (Saturday-Sunday), excluding any trend analysis involving these days.  
6. Output must be formatted as follows: if a date is part of an increasing trend on Monday to Wednesday or Thursday to Saturday, then print "Date X, Rise in pressure detected", whereas for decreasing on Tuesday to Thursday or Friday to Sunday, use the syntax "Date Y, Drop in pressure"; otherwise state "[Last Date in triplet], No notable change observed" if no trend is present.  
7. In addition to previous rules, ensure proper rounding of m_degF values (to two decimal places), and express these changes as increases or decreases from the base temperature rounded to one decimal place when required for annotation.  
8. If the provided sequence consists solely or largely of weekend dates or contains fewer than three usable entries for analysis, state "Data insufficient without significant trends", where "X" corresponds to the last date within the valid triplet range.  
9. Provide output as a newline-separated text list with precisely formatted analysis based on these specifications, maintaining standard English grammar rules (except that pressure changes should be indicated in millibars).   
10. You must also create visual clarity by italicizing the dates and using brackets for annotating the noted trend type or no change (`[No Notable Change]`), ensuring clear distinction from regular descriptions.  
- Additionally, your output needs to maintain a precise count of days with significant pressure changes compared to baseline mb conditions (not exceeding two decimal places) throughout your resultant list without summarizing at the end or providing aggregate statistics.
 
# Vocabulary
1. Base Date: "2023-05-03",  
    Average Pressure on this base date is 789 mb, thus `Base_Temperature` in Fahrenheit = 10(789) - 5 = 7840°F (rounded to nearest one decimal place for use). Use a similar sequence for more datasets if provided.  
2. Sequence of dates and their corresponding pressures: ["2023-05-04", "15,650 mb"], ["2023-05-07", "15,700 mb"], ["2023-05-08", "16,120 mb"], ["2023-05-09", "15,580 mb"],  
    ["2023-05-10", "16,780 mb"]  (Base_Temperature is calculated based on the average pressure of above given dates for new sequences).  

# Examples
1. For date sequence with Base Temperature: ["2023-04-15", "mb"], [...], calculate and provide corresponding output list.  
2." 2023-04-18", "pressure..." etc., providing the necessary rounding, trend analysis based on day of week exclusions, with pressure increase/decrease noted as specified in instructions.  
# Task Requirements for Triplet Analysis Date Sequence: ["2023-05-01", "mb"], ["2023-05-04", "mb"], ... , ["2023-05, 08", "MB"] and Base Temperature calculated from provided data.  

**Input for Instruction:**
Date Sequence: *["2023-05, 16.90 mb", "2023-05, 17.25 mb", "2023-05, 18.00 mb"]*, with Base_Temperature calculated according to given pressures on valid weekdays.
