Input: R
Number: 17

**Step by step justification:**  
- Since the number isn't a direct alphabetical position nor within the valid range of 0-25, we ignore it and keep the Letter (R).
- Number is odd; add 3 positions from 'R', which gives us U. (U â†’ F)
- The letter R doesn't complete any other rule conditions in this context so no additional transformations are necessary.

Output: R
