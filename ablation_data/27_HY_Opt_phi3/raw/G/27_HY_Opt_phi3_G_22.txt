This code snippet includes Rust's powerful `HashMap` structure for tracking unique word counts, along with advanced error handling and processing techniques like Unicode normalization—achieving memory efficiency by not duplicating word entries in the map if they already exist. It demonstrates an advanced non-naïve approach using a single loop comprehensively managing input strings without relying on common loops or conditionals explicitly named. The `HashMap` does not store duplicates, and its insertion order is preserved thanks to Rust's implementation that maintains the insert order as of recent versions (Possibly change for specific older compiler versions). 
The loop only runs until there are no more complaints left to process; it avoids storing word count more than once by leveraging ownership and borrowing semantics within `HashMap`. Note: This snippet assumes a predefined list of trivial words to be excluded, as mentioned in constraint #3. The normalization function could benefit from a more sophisticated error handling strategy depending on the real Unicode variations expected.
