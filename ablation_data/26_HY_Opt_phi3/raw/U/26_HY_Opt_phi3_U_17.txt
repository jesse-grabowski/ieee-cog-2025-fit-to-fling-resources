# Explanation

The code for the input "U" is generated by following the pattern specified in the Vocabulary section. In this mystical language, each line denotes a specific action required to construct part of the structure corresponding to the letter "U". Each `drop_block(code, number)` function represents adding blocks based on predetermined codes and quantities. The code 'b31' or 'b11', followed by a number is a unique combination for building a piece of this magical edifice. In this case, the blueprint (sequence) provided for 'U' involves three different instructions to successfully manifest its structure within Constructora.
