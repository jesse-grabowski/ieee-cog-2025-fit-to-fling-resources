To solve this task, we will follow the guidelines provided in the instructions. Each token `L#` in the input string should be converted into a corresponding block-dropping function call according to the given mappings. We apply these conversions and keep track of any special markers (`#`) for line breaks or duplication information. As per our example, we will only process tokens that correspond to valid block types from our mapping:

Input (Processed separately for each token):
```
Y0|Y1  # X2 Y3 Z1  
```
Output (Reconstructing the output for this partial input following provided instructions):

```
drop_block('b13', 0)  # drop_block('b13', 1) #  # drop_block('b11', 2)  # drop_block('b13', 3)  # drop_block('b31', 5)
```
