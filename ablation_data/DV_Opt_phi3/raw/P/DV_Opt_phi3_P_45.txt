1. For a conversion involving 'P', it's clear that according to Rule 4 of the original instructions, we cannot simply say it converts into F by default or any other letter from the given list unless specified in our provided mapping table for P. None of the letters Z, Y, X have mappings mentioned for them and therefore we can confirm no output result will come out as 'F'. Output: No Result
   
2. Now if there is a mistake pointed that A should convert to Z2 when numbers are between 36-50 instead of the original rule - this implies a significant overview on all conversions involving 'A' with a specific range for "Number" [36;50]. However, considering the provided sample 'Input M', it doesn't have any dependency since we don't exactly know how many times A or its corresponding mapped values are converted which could fall within such new proposed range. Therefore, given this new rule and our previous problem that Input: M Output: based on your new rule; Since there is no specified mapping for 'M', we do not have a defined output based on our new rule. Hence, the solution remains undefined under these conditions.
