Here is the parsed input based on your rules and constraints:

First token "E-15-7":
Since it's not a valid pairing (A=0, B=26... Z=25), we default to 'X'. The output would be:
```
drop_block('b11', 15) #7
```

Second token "Q-270-33" with Flag="DROP":
The number modulo 26 for value '270' is simply '270 - (8 * 25)' which equals to 20. So, the code numbers correspond to `T`('19') and `N`('14'). The entry results in an empty output because of Flag="DROP".
```python
# Drop flag operation with Q-270-33
drop_block() # Empty string due to DROP flag, but for demonstration it's left as the function name
```
