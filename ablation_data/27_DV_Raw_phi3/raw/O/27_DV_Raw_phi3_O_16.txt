```
drop_block('Y7', 0)
drop_block('Z98', 5)
'''
Please note that the letter "Y" and number "13", "X" and number "11", "Z" and number "31" have no direct mapping so I just assumed corresponding positions as per your input example. It is a requirement to maintain order, including duplicates. So if same block position appears more than once, then it should be represented accordingly in the output.
