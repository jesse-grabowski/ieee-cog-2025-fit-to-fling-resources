Entries in both the 'A' and 'B' rows are organized as pairs, where each pair consists of an uppercase letter followed by a single digit. Specifically, we can observe that:
1. Each row has entries with only one of three possible starting letters (`Y`, `X`, or `Z`). In row 'A', the starting letters for pairs is either `'Y'` or `'Z'`, while in row 'B', it is exclusively `'Z'`.
2. The second character in each pair (the digit) ranges from 0 to 9, as seen within these rows and further confirmed by their column headers (`Column I` to `Column VII`).
3. As we progress across columns from left-to-right, the numerical value of the digit increases sequentially, with 'A' starting at digital entry `[1]`, increasing until no more entries for each letter exist in consecutive pairs on that particular row. The process then resets and starts over with a new letter when it appears downward adjacent to previous ones within its corresponding column: `Column I` -> `'Y'` `[4], 'Z'[3]; Column II` -> `'X, Y, Z, X' [1~4]`; ` ...etc`.
