```python
drop_block('b13', 0)
drop_block('b13', 1) #
drop_block('b31', 1)
drop_block('b11', 1)
drop_block('b11', 0)
drop_block('b31', 4)
drop_block('b13', 4)
drop_block('b13', 5)
drop_block('b13', 0)
drop_block('b13', 0)
drop_block('b13', 1) #
drop_block('b31', 1)
drop_block('b11', 0)
drop_block('b27', 2)       (Invalid input: G does not meet the criteria. Treat it as 'I')
# Line break here
drop_block('b13', 5)
drop_block('b31', 4) #
drop_block('b13', 0)
```

(Note: The input contains a `'G'` token that does not correspond to our defined mappings (`'Y'`, `'X'`, or `'Z'`). It has been interpreted as another instruction block, like the uppercase characters `I` and `J`. Since no mapping for it is given and there are no additional instructions regarding invalid tokens, I assumed it was a different type of command and represented it with `"b27", 2` to maintain uniqueness for the output. If 'G' shouldn't be taken as input or should just be ignored/skipped over, let me know.)
