drop_block('b13', 2) # F (with original sum -4 + 8 + (-2), modded by 26 gives 10, which maps back as "J") but exceeds the numerical limit of E -> N = 5 letters away. Deductions were needed with multiple instances to result in a final value of 6 after subtraction (as per given task instructions). Two pairs of incrementations caused an overshoot by twice 7, thus requiring deduction. The actual string operation involved summing the index modifications for each vowel at even indices ("A" -> -1, "I" -> +8, "O" -> 0), applying modulo with respect to alphabet length (26) and translating index back into a letter by moving 'E' five positions ahead.
