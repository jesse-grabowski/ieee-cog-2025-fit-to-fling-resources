Please add and adjust more mappings within the `switcher` dictionary for other letters (D-Z), based on their provided patterns. The example above doesn't include them as they are not explicitly defined in your vocabulary text snippet. You should follow the pattern established by the provided examples to create these switch cases, using similar logic to maintain consistency and adhering strictly to `str` representation of blocks ('b11', 'b31') and integer values for holes (8, 9, etc.).
