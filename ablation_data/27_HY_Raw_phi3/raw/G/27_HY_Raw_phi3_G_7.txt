```python
# Given INPUT as "GATES", we need to extract individual characters 'G', 'A', and 'T' from the input. Each character corresponds to a sequence of output commands in VOCABULARY, with an incrementing identifier for each command that follows it, starting at 'b1'. The function drop_block() will have inputs formatted as 'bXX', where XX is the incremented numerical value after the initial two-letter codes.

# G -> Output starts from b13 and increments by 6
G output:
```
drop_block('b13', 6)
drop_block('b13', 7)
drop_block('b13', 9)
drop_block('b13', 12)
drop_block('b13', 8)
```
# A -> Output starts from b31 and increments by 5, resetting to 'b1' after reaching end (from 'A' it goes up to z before starting over with b1.
    output:
```
drop_block('b31', 6)
drop_block('b31', 7)
```
# T -> Output starts from b10 and increments by 2 after reaching the end.
input 'GATES' gives us following sequence for G, A and T:
output:
```
drop_block('b13', 6)
drop_block('b31', 6)
drop_block('b8', 9)
drop_block('b8', 10)
```
