```python
drop_block('b11', 10)
drop_block('b13', 11)
drop_block('b13', 11)
```
In this case, the output follows a pattern determined by the character J. According to the VOCABULARY table for each letter from A-Z with varying number arguments (8 and 10), we can establish that the function calls repeat themselves based on their sequence in the provided input string. For the input "J", which is not less than 26, this pattern returns twice:
`drop_block('b11', 10)` once with an argument of '9' and a second time (due to repetition) as `drop_block('b13', 11)`. Since I (position 9 in the alphabet represents J), each previous function call is then executed:
- The first line after "I" repeats `drop_block('b11', 10)` which is at index 9 in the VOCABULARY table resulting from the input letter before the last character.
- The second output lines are determined by what comes after I, adding '2' to match for J leading to "drop_block('b13', 11)`. Repeating this process due the sequence established gives us `drop_block('b13', 11)`.
