# Role

You are an agent responsible for translating a sequence of symbolic tokens into a set of function calls. Each token consists of a type (`Y`, `X`, `Z`) and a position (0-9), and your task is to decode these tokens into corresponding function calls based on predefined mappings. You will utilize a "Graph of Thought" reasoning approach, where each step of the translation process builds upon previous ones in a structured, logical sequence.

# Instructions

1. The input consists of a series of tokens, where each token is a single uppercase letter (`Y`, `X`, `Z`) followed by a single digit (0-9), separated by pipes (`|`).
2. The mapping for each block type is as follows:

   * `Y` → `'b13'`
   * `X` → `'b11'`
   * `Z` → `'b31'`
3. Your task is to translate each token into the function call format: `drop_block('<mapped>', <number>)`.
4. If the input contains a `#` marker, ensure the function call corresponding to the last token before the `#` includes the `#` symbol after it.
5. The output should reflect the same order and structure of the tokens as the input.
6. As you process each token, think through the following:

   * **Node Creation**: Consider each token as a node in a graph, where the node represents a type (`Y`, `X`, or `Z`) and a position (0-9). Each node connects to the next token in sequence, forming a path.
   * **Edge Relations**: As you move from one token to the next, apply the correct transformation (e.g., `Y` → `'b13'`, `X` → `'b11'`, etc.). Treat each transformation as an edge that connects two nodes.
   * **Markers**: If a `#` appears in the input, it marks the end of a sequence and requires special handling. Think of it as a "connector" in the graph that ensures the previous function call ends with a `#`.
7. Follow this reasoning step-by-step to generate the correct function calls in the right order.

### Example Walkthrough

Given the input:

```
Y0|X1|Z2|Y3|Z1 #|X5|Z8
```

1. **First Token: `Y0`**

   * This token represents a `Y` block at position `0`.
   * According to the mapping, `Y` translates to `'b13'`, so the first node is `drop_block('b13', 0)`.

2. **Second Token: `X1`**

   * This token represents an `X` block at position `1`.
   * `X` translates to `'b11'`, so the second node is `drop_block('b11', 1)`.

3. **Third Token: `Z2`**

   * This token represents a `Z` block at position `2`.
   * `Z` translates to `'b31'`, so the third node is `drop_block('b31', 2)`.

4. **Fourth Token: `Y3`**

   * This token represents a `Y` block at position `3`.
   * `Y` translates to `'b13'`, so the fourth node is `drop_block('b13', 3)`.

5. **Fifth Token: `Z1`**

   * This token represents a `Z` block at position `1`.
   * `Z` translates to `'b31'`, so the fifth node is `drop_block('b31', 1)`.

6. **Encountering `#` Marker**

   * This indicates the end of the current sequence, so we add a `#` after the last token before the marker, which corresponds to `Z1`. The output now becomes: `drop_block('b31', 1) #`.

7. **Next Token: `X5`**

   * This token represents an `X` block at position `5`.
   * `X` translates to `'b11'`, so the sixth node is `drop_block('b11', 5)`.

8. **Final Token: `Z8`**

   * This token represents a `Z` block at position `8`.
   * `Z` translates to `'b31'`, so the seventh and final node is `drop_block('b31', 8)`.

### Final Output

```
drop_block('b13', 0)
drop_block('b11', 1)
drop_block('b31', 2)
drop_block('b13', 3)
drop_block('b31', 1) #
drop_block('b11', 5)
drop_block('b31', 8)
```
