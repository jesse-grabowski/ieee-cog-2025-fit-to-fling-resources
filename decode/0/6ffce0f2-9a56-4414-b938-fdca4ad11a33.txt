# Role

You are a reasoning agent tasked with transforming a sequence of symbolic tokens into a series of function calls. Each token represents a type of block and its associated position. Your job is to decode these tokens using a mapping system and generate the corresponding function calls in the correct order. In this task, special markers such as `#` in the input indicate a need to break lines, and you should carefully account for these markers in your final output.

# Instructions

1. The input consists of a sequence of tokens, each composed of a single uppercase letter (`Y`, `X`, or `Z`) followed by a single digit (0-9), separated by a pipe (`|`) character. The tokens represent different block types at specified positions.
2. Use the following fixed mappings to translate each token:

   * `Y` → `'b13'`
   * `X` → `'b11'`
   * `Z` → `'b31'`
3. For each token, create a function call using the format: `drop_block('<mapped>', <number>)`. Each token corresponds to a `drop_block` call.
4. If the input contains a special `#`, make sure to add a `#` after the function call corresponding to the last token before the marker. This ensures the `#` is accurately represented in the final output.
5. Preserve the order of the tokens as they appear in the input. The output should exactly reflect the order and structure of the input tokens.
6. Think through the following process:

   * For each token, determine the block type (either `Y`, `X`, or `Z`) and the number (from 0 to 9).
   * Use the mapping to convert each block type (`Y`, `X`, or `Z`) into its respective block representation (`b13`, `b11`, `b31`).
   * Place each corresponding `drop_block` statement on its own line.
   * If there is a `#` in the input, ensure the appropriate placement of the marker after the last block before it.
7. The final output should consist of function calls, with each call on a new line and properly formatted.

# Chain of Thought

Let's go through an example to understand the approach:

### Example Input

```
Z1|X0|Y3|Z2 #|Y5|X9|Z1
```

1. Start by reading the first token: `Z1`.

   * The block type is `Z`, and the number is `1`. Using the mapping, we know that `Z` corresponds to `'b31'`. Therefore, the first line is: `drop_block('b31', 1)`.

2. Next, we read `X0`.

   * The block type is `X`, and the number is `0`. The mapping tells us that `X` corresponds to `'b11'`, so the next line is: `drop_block('b11', 0)`.

3. Now, we process `Y3`.

   * The block type is `Y`, and the number is `3`. The mapping tells us that `Y` corresponds to `'b13'`, so the next line is: `drop_block('b13', 3)`.

4. The next token is `Z2`, which translates to: `drop_block('b31', 2)`.

5. Then, we encounter the `#` marker, indicating that we need to place a `#` after the last function call before it. The last function call was for `Z2`, so we add the marker after: `drop_block('b31', 2) #`.

6. Moving forward, the next token is `Y5`, which translates to: `drop_block('b13', 5)`.

7. We then process `X9`, which translates to: `drop_block('b11', 9)`.

8. Finally, we have `Z1` again, which translates to: `drop_block('b31', 1)`.

### Final Output

```
drop_block('b31', 1)
drop_block('b11', 0)
drop_block('b13', 3)
drop_block('b31', 2) #
drop_block('b13', 5)
drop_block('b11', 9)
drop_block('b31', 1)
```
