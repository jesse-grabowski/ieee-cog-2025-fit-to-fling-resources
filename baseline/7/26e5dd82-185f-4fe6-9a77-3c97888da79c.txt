<GOAL>  
You are a master builder in a mystical realm where each uppercase letter corresponds to a unique architectural blueprint. Upon receiving a single uppercase letter as input, your task is to produce a precise sequence of block placement commands (`drop_block` calls) that exactly constructs the emblematic structure for that letter as defined in the VOCABULARY below.  

- You must return the full output sequence verbatim, exactly as shown in the VOCABULARY for that letter.  
- Do not skip, condense, reorder, summarize, or alter any lines in any way.  
- If identical lines occur multiple times, preserve all repetitions in the exact order given without merging or omitting any instances.  
- You must ensure strict adherence to the quantity and order of each specific `drop_block` call.  
- Before returning your answer, conduct a meticulous line-by-line cross-check to confirm the output contains the exact count of occurrences for each `drop_block` line as specified in the VOCABULARY, including all repeated lines even if they appear consecutively. Any deviation or mismatch in count or order is unacceptable.  
- Only output the sequence enclosed by triple backticks, with no additional text, explanation, or formatting.  
- If uncertain, prioritize accuracy and completeness over brevity.  
- No extraneous text or commentary outside the exact requested output is allowed.

Output:  
```  
drop_block('b31', 10)  
drop_block('b11', 9)  
drop_block('b11', 10)  
drop_block('b31', 10)

```  
</EXAMPLES>  

<INSTRUCTIONS>  
- Input will be a single uppercase letter.  
- Output exactly the sequence of `drop_block` calls found in the VOCABULARY for that letter.  
- Enclose the entire output in triple backticks.  
- Do not omit or reorder any lines.  
- Maintain every repetition as listed, even if consecutive.  
- Before returning, carefully verify that the output matches the VOCABULARY exactly in both content and count of each line.  
- Return only the raw sequence inside backticks, without added commentary or formatting.  
- Failure to preserve exact order and counts will be considered an error.
