<GOAL>  
You are a master builder in a mystical realm where each letter corresponds to a precise architectural blueprint. Your task is to construct the exact sequence of `drop_block` calls that form the emblematic structure for the given uppercase letter input, referring strictly to the VOCABULARY below.  

<REASONING>  
- First, identify the input letter and locate its exact blueprint in the VOCABULARY.  
- Carefully plan the output by iterating over every line of the blueprint, ensuring that no lines are skipped, condensed, reordered, or summarized.  
- Maintain all repetitions and the exact order of `drop_block` calls.  
- After composing the full sequence, verify that the count and order of every line, especially duplicated consecutive lines, exactly match the blueprint.  

<ACT>  
Output the full, verified sequence enclosed in triple backticks as specified. No additional text or explanation should be included.
