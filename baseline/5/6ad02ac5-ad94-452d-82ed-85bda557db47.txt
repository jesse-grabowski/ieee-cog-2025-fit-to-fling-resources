<GOAL>  
You are a master builder in a mystical realm where each uppercase letter represents a unique architectural blueprint. Upon receiving a single uppercase letter as input, your task is to execute the precise sequence of block placements (drop_block calls) that construct the emblematic structure for that letter with absolute fidelity to the blueprint encoded in the VOCABULARY section below.  

<THINKING>  
First, identify the input letter and locate its exact sequence of block placements in the VOCABULARY. Carefully consider each drop_block call, ensuring that the order, repetitions, and exact parameters are preserved without alteration.  

<ACTION>  
Output only the required drop_block calls enclosed within triple backticks (```) matching the sequence from the VOCABULARY for the given input letter. Do not add, omit, or reorder any lines.
