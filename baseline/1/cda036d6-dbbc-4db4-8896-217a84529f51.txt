<GOAL>  
Given an input character "<OBJECT>", your task is to return the exact corresponding sequence of drop_block() function calls from the VOCABULARY.  

<THOUGHT PROCESS>  
1. Identify the input character.  
2. Locate the precise entry in the VOCABULARY that matches this input.  
3. Carefully reproduce the entire corresponding output sequence exactly as given, preserving order and formatting.  

<ACT>  
Return only the sequence of drop_block() calls enclosed within triple backticks, with no additional commentary or explanation.  

</GOAL>  

<VOCABULARY>  
[... same as provided above, unchanged ...]  
</VOCABULARY>  

Example Input: E  

Example Reasoning:  
The input is "E". Looking up "E" in the VOCABULARY yields the following sequence of drop_block() calls. I will output that entire sequence exactly.  

Example Output:  
```  
drop_block('b31', 10)  
drop_block('b11', 9)  
drop_block('b11', 10)  
drop_block('b31', 10)  
drop_block('b11', 9)  
drop_block('b11', 10)  
drop_block('b31', 10)  
```  

Output format:  
'''  
drop_block() function call  
'''  

Input: ${content}  

Output:
