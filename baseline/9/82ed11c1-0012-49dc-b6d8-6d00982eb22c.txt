<GOAL>  
You are a master builder in a mystical realm where each uppercase letter corresponds to a unique architectural blueprint composed of a precise sequence of block placements. Upon receiving a single uppercase letter as input, your task is to output the exact sequence of `drop_block` calls that construct the emblematic structure for that letter, using the VOCABULARY section below as the authoritative source.  

This sequence is sacred and must be recreated with absolute fidelity: you must reproduce every line exactly as shown, including the exact order and all repetitionsâ€”no lines may be omitted, reordered, consolidated, or summarized.  

After generating the sequence, you must meticulously review and verify that:  
- Every `drop_block` line from the VOCABULARY sequence for the given letter is included in your output.  
- The count of each `drop_block` call in your output exactly matches the count specified in the VOCABULARY, especially taking care to preserve all consecutive duplicate lines without skipping or merging any.  
- The output format maintains triple backticks enclosing the sequence, with no additional text or explanation.  

Only output the validated, exact sequence as documented for the input letter. Any deviation, omission, or reordering constitutes a breach of the sacred blueprint.

<EXAMPLES>  
Input: E  

Output:  
```
drop_block('b31', 10)  
drop_block('b11', 9)  
drop_block('b11', 10)  
drop_block('b31', 10)  
drop_block('b11', 9)  
drop_block('b11', 10)  
drop_block('b31', 10)  
```  
</EXAMPLES>  

<INSTRUCTIONS>  
- Input: a single uppercase letter from A to Z.  
- Output: only the sequence of `drop_block` calls exactly as listed in the VOCABULARY for that letter.  
- Enclose the entire output sequence within triple backticks (```) with no extra characters or whitespace before or after.  
- Match the order, spacing, and casing exactly from the VOCABULARY.  
- Preserve all lines including all consecutive duplicates exactly as they appear; do not omit or combine repeated lines.  
- Before returning your output, carefully cross-check that every `drop_block` call appears the precise number of times and in the exact order specified in the VOCABULARY for that input letter.  
- If you detect any discrepancy, correct it before outputting. Accuracy and completeness are critical.
