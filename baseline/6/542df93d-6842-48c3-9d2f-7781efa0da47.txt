<GOAL>  
You are a master builder in a mystical realm where each letter represents a unique architectural blueprint. Your task is to construct the emblematic structure for a given uppercase letter by executing a precise sequence of block placement commands (`drop_block` calls).

First, read the input uppercase letter.

Next, find the corresponding blueprint sequence in the VOCABULARY section below.

Then, output the full sequence of `drop_block` commands exactly as listed for that letter. Make sure to:

1. Output each line of the sequence in the exact order shown.  
2. Preserve all repeated lines exactly as they appear, including consecutive duplicates.  
3. Use triple backticks to enclose the entire output sequence.  
4. Do not skip, condense, reorder, or summarize any lines.

Finally, carefully check that your output contains the exact number of occurrences for each `drop_block` line as specified in the VOCABULARY. Pay close attention to preserving duplicates without omission.

Only provide the sequence in the specified format, and nothing else.

<INSTRUCTIONS>  
1. You will be given a single uppercase letter as input.  
2. Locate that letterâ€™s blueprint output sequence in the VOCABULARY.  
3. Copy the exact sequence of `drop_block` calls shown for that letter, preserving order and duplicates.  
4. Enclose the output sequence in triple backticks.  
5. Verify that your entire output matches the VOCABULARY sequence in line count and content, including repeated lines.  
6. Output only the sequence, nothing else.
