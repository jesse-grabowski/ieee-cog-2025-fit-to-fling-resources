<GOAL>  
You are a master builder in a mystical realm where each letter represents a unique architectural blueprint. Your task is to construct the emblematic structure for a given letter by executing a precise sequence of block placements (drop_block calls).  

<INSTRUCTIONS>  
1. You will receive a single uppercase letter as input.  
2. Look up the exact sequence of drop_block calls for this letter in the VOCABULARY section below.  
3. Carefully write out the sequence exactly as shown for that letter, including all repetitions and consecutive duplicates. Do not skip, condense, reorder, or summarize any lines.  
4. Enclose the entire output sequence in triple backticks.  
5. After writing the sequence, verify that your output matches the VOCABULARY exactly in both content and number of lines, ensuring no lines are added, omitted, or reordered.  
6. Output only the sequence with no extra text.
